                            <span class="presentation-date">Jan 11, 2025</span><br>
                            <em>Short Undergraduate Mathematics Seminar (SUMS) 123<br>(Jointly with Aaditya Vicram Saraf)</em>
                            <span><strong>Abstract: </strong>The talk delves into a problem of chopping a regular n-gon into k many regular n-gons. The main problem would be to find all possible values of k for a given n such that we can chop the n - gon into k many regular n - gons. This is a generalization of the problem of dividing a square into k smaller squares (where instead of answering the problem just for squares, we answer it for any n sided regular polygon).</span>

                            <span class="presentation-date">Nov 2, 2024</span><br>
                            <em>Student Research Seminar (SRS) 39</em>
                            <span><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this talk, we'll explore some interesting results in real and harmonic analysis, starting with the Hardy-Littlewood Maximal Operator. This operator helps in understanding the behaviour of the average and maximal operators of a function. We'll look at the Hardy-Littlewood Maximal Inequality and understand its proof using a method with dyadic cubes and interpolation of operators. Then, using this inequality and a few other results, we'll prove the Lebesgue Differentiation Theorem, which basically tells how to recover a function from its averages. Along the way, we'll briefly detour into Calder√≥n-Zygmund Decomposition - a technique that breaks down functions into "good" and "bad" parts. Finally, we'll dive into the Hilbert transform and its behaviour using results by Riesz and Kolmogorov.

                            <span class="presentation-date">Apr 6, 2024</span><br>
                            <em>Student Research Seminar (SRS) 35</em>
                            <span><strong>Abstract: </strong>This talk explores the fundamental theorems of optimization in normed spaces, with a focus on the powerful Euler-Lagrange equation. After establishing the groundwork of continuity, differentiability, and optimization conditions in normed spaces, we'll discuss the derivation and application of the Euler-Lagrange equation for constrained optimization problems.<br>A key highlight is the solution to the famous brachistochrone problem, which seeks the shape of the curve that minimizes the time taken by a particle to slide from one point to another under the influence of gravity. By applying the Euler-Lagrange equation, the optimal curve (the brachistochrone) is derived, demonstrating the practical relevance of these optimization techniques.</span>

                            <em>Student Undergraduate Mathematics Seminar (SUMS) 118<br>(Jointly with Aaditya Vicram Saraf)</em>
                            <span><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this talk, we will cover what is a twin prime and some interesting results. We prove that the digital root of the product of any twin primes is always 8. We introduce Euler totient function and sigma function (sum of divisors), which reveal another beautiful result about twin primes.<br>Finally, we conclude by talking about how often primes occur as we move further along the number line and that there are approximately n/logn primes less than n (no proof).</span>

                            <em>IoT Project</em>
                            <span><strong>DoorDarshan</strong> is a remote access control system that allows members of the RoboTech Club at NISER to remotely lock and unlock the door to the club's lab using Discord chat commands. It uses a Raspberry Pi computer interfaced with an electronic door lock and custom Discord bot software to provide secure keyless entry. Authorized club members who have access to the DoorDarshan Discord channel can issue simple textual commands to toggle the state of the lock without needing physical keys. Additionally, a display screen positioned outside the lab door connects to the Raspberry Pi to showcase important club announcements, including upcoming events, authorized lab access lists, weather and time information. This project was conceived to enhance security and convenience of lab access. It also served as a hands-on IoT and robotics learning experience involving hardware integration, embedded programming, and software development. Overally, DoorDarshan demonstrates an automation solution for secure remote access control and management.</span>

                <h3>Pi Day 2024</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="club-details">
                <p>I was a core member of the organizing team for Pi Day 2024, serving as the head of the MathematiX Club at the time. This exciting joint event, organized by our club and the Mathematics Department at NISER, took place on March 14th and 15th, 2024.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The event kicked off with a series of engaging math demonstrations designed to make mathematics accessible and fun for everyone. One highlight for me was presenting the famous Chessboard and Coin Puzzle, which got the audience thinking.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In addition to the demonstrations, the day featured Cryptarythm Chaos, a fun math riddle treasure hunt in which I also participated, and a lively Panel Discussion where selected teachers and students fielded questions on everything from mathematics to career advice. A memorable moment was the pi-shaped cake cutting ceremony at 1:59 PM on March 14th‚Äîa true slice of Pi Day!</p>
                <br>
                <p>Pi Day 2024 remains one of the most honorable student-organized events in our Mathematics Department, and it holds a special place in my heart. I'm excited to share that I'm already on the organizing team for this year's Pi Day (2025) and can't wait to bring even more creative math fun to our community.</p>
